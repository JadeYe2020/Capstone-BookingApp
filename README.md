## Scenario 
For the Capstone project in the last term, my team built an Android app which could handle usersâ€™ bookings and control customer flow through limiting timeslots availability.

## Challenge
We had to do our research in order to realize the features we wanted, which sometimes brought unwanted bugs. 

As a result, there was even more research to do just to fix the bugs. Thankfully, all team members were proactive which gave us more time to dwell into bug-fixing.
Outcome: The application works as expected and we are happy with the final product.

## Outcome
The application works as expected and we are happy with the final product.

## Reflection 
* Time management is even more important when it comes to group projects. Communication plays a crucial part as well, because we need to know where the project progress is, and which task is the priority at that moment in order to keep the project going as smoothly as possible.
* GitHub is a great tool to manage code cooperation. We could have avoided the version control related issues, had we known how to utilize GitHub in a group setting.
